          Student Directory is a one stop destination for all information
          related to a particular department’s students. It is a digital vault
          made to ease the communication bridge between department and the
          administrative team. It is made using the reactjs, the leading web
          development software in IT industry. It can keep track of a variety of
          information ranging from academics to placement status of any student.
          It will be convenient for the faculty if a student’s details are under
          one roof or rather a single website in this regard. We hope you will
          have a smooth experience on this site.
